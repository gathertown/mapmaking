## Tileset Naming Convention
### for tilesets (.tsx)
`Group Name #.x.tsx`
Where
- `Group` is likely "Gather"
- `Name` is the tileset name, like "Floors" or "Decoration"
- `#` is the major version number. Like all versioning systems, anything contained in a "major version" (to the left of the .) are compatible with themselves.
- `x` is literally "x"

### for tilesheets (".png")
`group_name_#.#.png`
- `group` is likely "gather"
- `name` is the tilesheet name, like 'floors' or 'decoration'
- `#` is the major version number. Like all versioning systems, anything contained in a "major version" (to the left of the .) are compatible with themselves.
- `#` is the minor version number. Consider these small changes like little refinements or adding more items without moving anything around.

example:
- `Gather Floors 1.x.tsx` points to `gather_floors_1.3.png`. If the tilesheet is updated (from 1.3 to 1.4) then
- `Gather Floors 1.x.tsx` points to `gather_floors_1.4.png`.
